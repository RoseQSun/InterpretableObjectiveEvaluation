# Interpretable Objective Evaluation of Generative Models in Symbolic Music
## Description
While innovative architectures come out every year claiming their improved usefulness in modeling human-level creativity, state-of-the-art generative music sys- tems still struggle with creating musical content that follows technical rules and expectations. The current project describes a reproducible and highly interpretable approach for evaluating the output of symbolic music generation models, especially in the context of deep learning, using a set of musicologically-informed objective metrics. To demonstrate the effectiveness of such an approach, we propose to evaluate established, widely-used deep melody generation models whose training data is fully accessible, and to obtain the aforementioned evaluation metrics from a systematic, empirical computational musicological analysis of the training data. By examining the generated data under these metrics, we will be able to formatively assess if the model behaves as expected, and advise on areas of improvement. With the incorporation of domain knowledge, in practice, this study will provide means to formulate detailed evaluation with respect to non-trivial music characteristics.
